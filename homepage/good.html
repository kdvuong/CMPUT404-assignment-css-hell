              <p>
                I'm Khang! This Fall I will be in my 5th year of software
                engineering. Currently I'm working at Intuit as an intern.
                Outside of work, I enjoy playing games on my PC or Switch.
                Sometimes if the mood is right, I might even learn some new
                technologies by myself! üòÅ

            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <p>
              My professional experience outside of school includes 2
              internships, both at Intuit. For my first internship, my
              responsibilities are front end development for Intuit's Quickbooks
              Online. For my current internship, I've moved to a new team and
              taken on more responsibilities. My current role includes full
              stack development as well as dev-op work surrounding AWS
              infrastructure and Kubernetes microservices.

            <h3>What I Can Offer</h3>
            <p>
              I can code proficiently in TypeScript and Python. For front end
              development, my tool of trade is React. For back end projects, I
              have experience in both Typescript and Python. I value clean code
              quality, modularity, and testability.
            </p>
            <p>
              My most valuable assets are adaptability and quick learning.
              Before my second internship, I have zero knowledge about AWS
              infrastructure and Kubernetes. Through self learning and
              on-the-job experience, I have successfully set up infrastructure
              as code using AWS CloudFormation for my team which significantly
              ease up our deployment process.
