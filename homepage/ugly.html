      <h3>Khang Who?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Khang! This Fall I will be in my 5th year of software engineering.
        Currently I'm working at Intuit as an intern. Outside of work, I enjoy
        playing games on my PC or Switch. Sometimes if the mood is right, I
        might even learn some new technologies by myself!
      </p>

      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <p>
        My professional experience outside of school includes 2 internships,
        both at Intuit. For my first internship, my responsibilities are front
        end development for Intuit's Quickbooks Online. For my current
        internship, I've moved to a new team and taken on more responsibilities.
        My current role includes full stack development as well as dev-op work
        surrounding AWS infrastructure and Kubernetes microservices.

        <h3>What I Can Offer</h3>
        <p>
          I can code proficiently in TypeScript and Python. For front end
          development, my tool of trade is React. For back end projects, I
          have experience in both Typescript and Python. I value clean code
          quality, modularity, and testability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most valuable assets are adaptability and quick learning.
          Before my second internship, I have zero knowledge about AWS
          infrastructure and Kubernetes. Through self learning and
          on-the-job experience, I have successfully set up infrastructure
          as code using AWS CloudFormation for my team which significantly
          ease up our deployment process.
